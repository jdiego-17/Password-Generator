## Summary
Here is how the password is generated:
* Created variables for numbers, symbols, and letters
* To change the letters to uppercase i created a fuction and applied it to a variable named: upper.
* created a function that generates the password
* Within the generatePassword function, I used a for loop to generate ramdom passwords with the created
variables that hold the numbers symbols and letters
* Within the generatePassword function, I used a if and else if statements to generate a series of prompts with each one having a criteria to choose.
* By combining all the code created, the app is able to generate a passwrod and show prompts.
